## Medium Article

This project is accompanied by a detailed Medium article titled "Intermediate Android Compose - Profile Card." You can read the article [here]().

## Overview

`ProfileCardComposable` is an Android UI built using Jetpack Compose. This project showcases the development of a `ProfileCard()` composable.

Key features of the `ProfileCard()` include:

- Modular Design: The ProfileCard() is divided into separate components like `ProfileHeader()`, `SocialMediaIcons()`, and `ProfileActionButtons()`, enhancing code maintainability, readability, and collaboration efficiency.
- Customization and Flexibility: Offers extensive customization options for each component, including colors, text, images, and shapes, ensuring that the profile card can be easily tailored to fit any app's design and branding needs.
- Efficient Image Handling with Coil: Utilizes Coil for image loading, offering efficient processing and caching of images, which is crucial for performance in image-heavy UI components.
- Interactive Elements: Incorporates interactive UI elements like social media icon buttons and action buttons, providing a dynamic user experience.
- Adaptive Layout: Designed with responsive principles, ensuring the `ProfileCard()` looks great across different screen sizes and orientations.
- Modern UI with Jetpack Compose: Built using Jetpack Compose, the latest UI toolkit for Android, leveraging the benefits of a declarative UI approach for more intuitive and concise UI code.
- Previews for Development Ease: Includes Composable Preview functions for each component, facilitating rapid and iterative development by allowing developers to see changes in real time.
- Simple Color Theming: Offers a straightforward theming system with primary, secondary, and tertiary colors to easily adjust the overall appearance of the card.
- Scalability and Reusability: The modular nature of the components makes them reusable in different parts of the app, reducing redundancy and facilitating scalability.
